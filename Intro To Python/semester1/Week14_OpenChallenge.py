    THIS WEEK IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT...

    The challenges are simpler than some we've done before, BUT:

        There is no code to begin with... DUN DUN DUN!

 --- These three things we will do together
    Challenge 1 : Create a class, representing OUR PYTHON CLASS
                  which has methods/attributes to answer these questions:

                    - How many people are in the class room?
                    - How many people usually come to class?
                    - What is the location of the class?
                    - What are the names of all the students?
                    - What is the name of the teacher?

    Challenge 2 : Use the module "urllib" to access https://www.khanacademy.org/
                  and then print the easter egg at the top of the html!

    Challenge 3 : Catch a failure and redirect with try/except

                For example, if you try to do:
                        1 + 'fish'  ---> you'll get a "TypeError"

                So, use try/except to redirect that error into something else

--- This one you guys are on your own (for a while)

    Challenge 4.1 : Use the "socket" module to send a message from one python
                    window to another, on your computer screen

                    Big hint: USE "UDP COMMUNICATION" AND GOOGLE

    Challenge 4.2 :
            (Teams) : Use the "socket" module to send a message to
                            your friends computer (on the same wifi network)

                            Big hint: USE "UDP COMMUNICATION"
